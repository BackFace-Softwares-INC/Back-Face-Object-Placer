A simple Godot addon to place 3D objects/nodes on a 3D scene at mouse position using raycast.

# How to use:
Clone this repo pasting this command on terminal:

```
After the repo is cloned, place the addons folder in your project.
Enable the addon on ```Project > Project Settings > Plugins > BackFaceObjectPlacer```

After enabling the plugin, a new tab named "Object Placer" should appear in the bottom panel, place the object (PackedScene) in the empty slot, set the offset and enable, then just click on the location where you want to place the object.
